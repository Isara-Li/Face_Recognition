# Face Detection Model

This repository contains a face detection model that I developed from scratch using a neural network. The model is designed to recognize and detect faces with high accuracy.

## Project Overview

In this project, I built and trained a custom face detection model from the ground up. The process involved designing a neural network architecture,collecting data, preprocessing data, and implementing a custom loss function to optimize the model's performance specifically for face detection tasks.

## Key Features

- **Neural Network Architecture**: The model is based on a custom-built neural network tailored for face detection. It was designed with a focus on accuracy and efficiency.

- **Custom Loss Function**: To enhance the modelâ€™s ability to correctly detect faces, I implemented a custom loss function. This loss function was crafted to prioritize the accurate identification of face regions, reducing false positives and improving the overall detection precision.

- **Training Process**: The model was trained on a diverse dataset of face images, using techniques such as data augmentation and regularization (e.g., dropout) to improve generalization and prevent overfitting.

- **Performance**: After extensive training and tuning, the model demonstrated reasonable accuracy in detecting faces across various test cases, including different lighting conditions, angles, and face sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **Albumentations**: Used for image augmentation to improve the robustness of the model by applying various transformations to the training images.
  
- **Labelme**: Employed for annotating images, allowing for the precise labeling of face regions in the dataset.

- **OpenCV (cv2)**: Utilized for image processing tasks, such as reading and manipulating images before feeding them into the neural network.

- **TensorFlow & Keras**: TensorFlow was used as the primary deep learning framework, with Keras serving as the high-level API. The `tensorflow.keras.applications` module was used to import the VGG16 architecture as the base network for transfer learning.

- **VGG16**: A pre-trained VGG16 model from the Keras applications library was used as the base network. This model served as the foundation, with additional layers added to tailor it specifically for face detection tasks.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by a tutorial video by Nicholas Renotte, titled "Train a Face Detection Model from Scratch," which guided the foundational aspects of building and training a neural network for face detection.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `FaceRec.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
3. Follow the steps to load the dataset, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
4. Use the trained model to detect faces in new images or integrate it into larger applications.

## Future Work

- **Model Optimization**: Further refinement of the neural network architecture and the custom loss function to enhance detection accuracy and efficiency.

- **Real-Time Detection**: Development of a real-time face detection application using this trained model.
