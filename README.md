# Face Detection Model

This repository contains a face detection model that I developed from scratch using a neural network. The model is designed to recognize and detect faces in images with high accuracy.

## Project Overview

In this project, I built and trained a custom face detection model from the ground up. The process involved designing a neural network architecture, preprocessing data, and implementing a custom loss function to optimize the model's performance specifically for face detection tasks.

## Key Features

- **Neural Network Architecture**: The model is based on a custom-built neural network tailored for face detection. It was designed with a focus on accuracy and efficiency.

- **Custom Loss Function**: To enhance the modelâ€™s ability to correctly detect faces, I implemented a custom loss function. This loss function was crafted to prioritize the accurate identification of face regions, reducing false positives and improving the overall detection precision.

- **Training Process**: The model was trained on a diverse dataset of face images, using techniques such as data augmentation and regularization (e.g., dropout) to improve generalization and prevent overfitting.

- **Performance**: After extensive training and tuning, the model demonstrated high accuracy in detecting faces across various test cases, including different lighting conditions, angles, and face sizes.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by a tutorial video by Nicholas Renotte, titled "Train a Face Detection Model from Scratch," which guided the foundational aspects of building and training a neural network for face detection.

## Files Included

- **FaceRec.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook detailing the entire model development process, including data preprocessing, neural network architecture, custom loss function implementation, training, and evaluation.

- **Model Weights**: Pre-trained weights for the model are included, allowing for direct usage or further fine-tuning based on specific requirements.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `FaceRec.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
3. Follow the steps to load the dataset, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
4. Use the trained model to detect faces in new images or integrate it into larger applications.

## Future Work

- **Model Optimization**: Further refinement of the neural network architecture and the custom loss function to enhance detection accuracy and efficiency.

- **Real-Time Detection**: Development of a real-time face detection application using this trained model.
